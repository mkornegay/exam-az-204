See the individual directory's LICENSE.txt file for the license associated
with each sample. If the sample itself does not have a LICENSE.txt file, then
either the parent directory will have a LICENSE.txt file covering all samples
for the children or the self-contained sample file will have the license terms
at the top of the file.
