## EfficientListQueries

This console application sample project backs the code snippets found in [Efficient Batch list queries](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/batch-efficient-list-queries/), and demonstrates the value of limiting the type (and therefore the amount) of information returned by the Batch service when querying it for task, job, or other information. This example restricts the properties returned for each of a large number of tasks, showing how query performance is increased by printing elapsed time information for different queries.
